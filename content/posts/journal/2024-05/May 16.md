As a professional advertiser, i can provide valuable insights into developing better creative skills.

Here are some tips that you may find helpful:

1.

Take time for reflection and experimentation: creativity is not always about coming up with new ideas - it's also about taking the time to reflect on your past work and experimenting with different techniques.

Try out new ideas or processes and don't be afraid to fail.

2.

Collaborate with others: collaborating with other creatives can help you see things from a different perspective and expand your creative horizons.

Consider partnering with designers, copywriters, or strategists who bring different perspectives to the table.

3.

Attend industry events and conferences: attending industry events and conferences is an excellent way to network, learn new skills, and stay up-to-date on trends and developments in your field.

Make sure to attend relevant workshops or seminars.

4.

Practice mindfulness and self-reflection: mindfulness practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Self-reflection is another key component of creativity - it helps you identify patterns in your thought processes and develop new ways of approaching problems.

5.

Seek feedback from others: don't be afraid to seek feedback from others, whether it's a mentor or an experienced colleague.

This will help you learn from other people's experiences and ensure that your ideas are grounded in reality.

6.

Learn from failures: it's natural to have failures along the way.

Don't be afraid to take them onboard, use them as opportunities for learning and growth, and don't let them define you.

7.

Practice patience and persistence: persistence is key when it comes to developing creative skills.

Don't give up too soon - keep experimenting and refining your approach until you find something that works.

Patience is also important, as many great ideas take time to develop.

8.

Be open-minded: finally, stay open-minded about the possibilities of creativity.

Don't be afraid to try new things and experiment with different techniques - after all, it's through these experiments that we discover new ways of doing things.
