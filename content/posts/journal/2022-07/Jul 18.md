What to do if English is not your native language? Well, you start to use the Grammarly plugin, of course. And you love it. And you hate it. And you adore it. And you despise it.

It is probably the one tool that can assist you in improving your writing skill.

Boy, oh boy. It is one tool that gives you hell, also.

Correctness score? Clarity? Engagement? Delivery and overall score? For my dogs' sake, Grammarly! Am I trying to pass an exam here?

All jokes aside, I should mention that it is one of the best tools online. Like really. The top-notch. 

It works as a browser plugin, an app and a desktop application. It is worth mentioning that a desktop version works on Windows only. So, if you use a Linux distro, you already know what to do. Install it as a browser plugin! Log in, go to "My Grammarly", and start typing your post.

Come one, give it a test drive. Right now. Now. Or maybe now! Improve your writing.
