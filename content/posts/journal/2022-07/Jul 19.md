> Feynman's technique

Nothing too much interesting happened today. Just as usual. It is worth mentioning that I managed to stumble on one good technique called "Feynman's technique". Its purpose - memorize and recall the information a bit faster. I think that I already use it, but I will try to dig into this deeper. There are still some unknown variables. Well, at least for me.
