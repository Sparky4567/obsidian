Some of you might be interested in the information I use in writing my newest blog posts. 

  

I can tell you one thing. I use multiple sources from different places all around the internet and even some of my old notebooks.

  

Almost every time I need to write something about the code or tools I use, I read lots of documentation and test a few things before writing. I want to make correct assumptions based on my personal experience, so that is why I investigate a bunch of functionalities myself. 

  

That is helpful when you want to write some lengthy technical texts, but what about something else?

  

Would it be possible to use any of the TikTok videos as a base material for a start? Well, of course, it would. Though, you would need to view the material as sceptically as possible. Not everything you find on the internet is the truth. You may need to make the conclusions yourselves. 

  

So my recipe is:

  

1.  Watch the video.
2.  Identify which parts of it are accurate and which are not.
3.  Recheck the information.
4.  Read some documentation or research papers if it is possible.
5.  Is there a chance that you could test the theory? Test it!
6.  Write down your conclusions.
7.  Write your post and publish it.
