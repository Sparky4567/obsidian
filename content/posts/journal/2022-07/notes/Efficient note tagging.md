# Efficient note tagging

So, how do you use tagging in obsidian? I will share some of my ideas. You do not have to follow this blindly.

  

These are just a few tactics I use myself.

  

# Let us start with ABC'S

  

ABC'S? Yes, literally. 

  

You can grab a community plugin called "Advanced tables" and use one of my tiny templates called "ABC".

  

1.  Write a text
2.  Insert a template
3.  Okay, what is next?

  

The third step is to partially fill the table with words that can relate to your text.

  

Let me give you a short example.

| Letter | Word |
| ------ | ---- |
| A      |  a    |
| B      |   b   |
| C      |  c    |
| D      |      |
| E      |      |
| F      |      |
| G      |      |
| H      |      |
| I      |      |
| J      |      |
| K      |      |
| L      |      |
| M      |      |
| N      | note     |
| O      |      |
| P      |      |
| Q      |      |
| R      |      |
| S      | start     |
| T      |  tagging    |
| U      |      |
| V      |      |
| W      |      |
| X      |      |
| Y      |      |
| Z       |      |


As soon as you feel that the words are a good fit for your text, turn them into tags.


# Better solution

  

Organize your notebook rightly and make a good folder structure. Each year should have a separate directory. Moreover, even months should have their folders. 

  

Yes, yes. But why? The answer is obsidians - Graph view. It is a distinctive feature that allows inspecting your ideas with accuracy. 

  

Some of my notes are from the same month and year. So, with a bit of logical reasoning, it means that I can attach specific tags, like: "2022", "Jul", or "new_post".

  

The final results of this kind of approach will look fun. But for now, it looks like the picture below.
