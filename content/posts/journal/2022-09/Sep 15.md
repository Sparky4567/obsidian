> A new ReactJS project

Hello, blog readers. I want to share with you one of my recent projects. It is a basic image watermarking tool built purely with the ReactJS framework and some extra libraries to manipulate your chosen illustrations. 

## Short instructions on how to use the tool

Follow the link https://watermark.artefaktas.eu/, upload an image, change the default watermark text, adjust the font size and press "Watermark It".

Finally, press the download button to store a modified image on your computer.

P.s. Some additional functions are still buggy. You can add a few extra effects if you want to. Although, each of them should be applied separately by choosing the filter, using the slider to regulate the strength of an effect and clicking "Apply filter". 

By the way, you can install the app as a PWA application on your favourite devices.
