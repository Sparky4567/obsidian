# Oct 22

> [!tldr] Oct 22
> Save some of your precious time and visit my GitHub project

This post is a little reminder to myself. Although it is possible to migrate existing Hugo websites from Firebase, it requires a lot of work to do so. But to convert one into an Obsidian vault is another level. If you visited this website to find an answer to how to achieve by yourselves, I recommend taking a look at my GitHub project existing here: https://github.com/Sparky4567/obsidian. It will save some time.
