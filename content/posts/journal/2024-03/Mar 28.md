In today's digital age, staying creative has become increasingly important. With all the distractions and interruptions, it can be challenging to find time for creativity in our busy schedules. But let me share with you a few tips on how to stay creative!

1. Take breaks: Sometimes we get so caught up in work or life that we forget to take breaks. Take a break every hour or two, even if it's just a few minutes. It will help refresh your mind and energy, which will allow you to be more productive during the rest of your day.

2. Create an environment: Choose a space where you can focus on your creative work without distractions like music or noise. Try to find a quiet and serene place where you won't be bothered by anyone, even if it means spending an extra $50 for a room with no neighbors.

3. Read: Reading is a great way to unwind and relax. There are plenty of books on creativity that will help you think more creatively. Don't just read about ideas, though; try to apply what you learn in practice.

4. Take inspiration from others: It's easy to get lost in our own creative work. But sometimes it can be helpful to take inspiration from other people's work. Look for creatives who are like-minded and see how they approach their craft.

5. Stay curious: Curiosity is one of the keys to staying creative. It helps us keep exploring different ideas, even if we don't know where it will take us. Don't be afraid to try new things or take risks.

6. Practice regularly: Even though it may seem like a waste of time, practicing creativity is important. Even if you only spend an hour a day, that's still better than nothing at all.

7. Be open to ideas: Don't be afraid to let your mind run wild and come up with new ideas. It's much more likely that you'll get something good out of it when you have to think outside the box.

8. Take risks: Lastly, don't be too scared to take risks in your creative work. Don't be afraid to try new things or to push yourself beyond what you thought was possible. Sometimes taking a risk will lead to something great.

In conclusion, staying creative is not just about having an idea, but also practicing and exploring ideas regularly. These tips can help you in your journey towards becoming more creative. Remember, the most important thing is to be patient and continue to practice until you find what works for you.
