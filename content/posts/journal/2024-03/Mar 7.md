> TLDR
> Text is too short to sumarize

> "Writing is one of the most beautiful and transformative crafts we all know. It's like a painter who paints with words, to create a canvas that speaks on its own. As I sit here, lost in my thoughts, writing this, i feel a sense of euphoria that i haven't felt in some time. There is no greater joy than when the words you pour into your pen bring joy to those who read them." - unknown (born 1903-died 2000)
