As a busy programmer and project manager, I know how important it is to be efficient and focused to get things done. Here are some nowaday technologies that can help you stay productive:

1. Productivity software: There are several productivity software tools out there, such as Trello, Asana, Monday, and Monday.com. These apps help you manage your tasks, create timelines, and track progress. They can be customized to fit your work style and workflows.

2. Time-tracking apps: There are many time-tracking apps available for both iOS and Android devices. These tools help you keep track of the hours spent on each task. This data can be analyzed to identify areas where you can improve productivity.

3. Pomodoro technique: The Pomodoro technique involves working in 25-minute "sprints" with short breaks, known as pomodoros. It helps break down work into smaller, more manageable chunks and encourages the use of task lists to track progress.

4. Project management tools: These tools help you set priorities, assign tasks, track progress, and communicate with stakeholders. Some popular project management tools include Asana, Trello, and Monday.com.

5. Time blocking: Time blocking is a technique where you schedule your work in blocks of time, rather than using the standard 9-to-5 work day. This can help prevent burnout and increase focus.

6. Resilience training: Resilience training helps you cope with stress and handle setbacks. It involves practicing positive self-talk, meditation, and mindfulness exercises.

7. Time-blocking for meetings: Use time blocking for meetings to manage the length of each meeting and minimize distractions. This can help you stay on track and avoid getting sidetracked.

By using nowaday technologies, you can stay productive by managing your workload efficiently, increasing focus, improving time management skills, reducing stress, and avoiding burnout.
