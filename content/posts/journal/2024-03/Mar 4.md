# Mar 4

> Text is too short to sumarize

In the woods, amidst the trees,
where shadows dance and the leaves sway,
a gentle breeze whispers softly,
as leaves whisper secrets they keep.

Wildflowers bloom in the springtime,
and the air is filled with song,
the rustling of leaves, and the hum of bees,
all blend together in a symphony.

A bird sings, in a sweet melody,
as birdsong echoes through the night,
a symphony of sounds that never cease,
in this tranquil forest, where they're free.

The rustling of leaves in the wind,
is like the whispers of an old tale,
a story of life that goes unspoken,
and love that lingers on for evermore.

For in this woodland wilderness,
where shadows hide and secrets are told,
this forest is a place where dreams abound,
in a world of magic and wonder.
