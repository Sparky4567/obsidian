I can provide you with some general tips and insights on optimizing your current website for better performance, but i cannot offer specific advice based on your individual situation. Here are some broad recommendations:

1. Conduct thorough keyword research: knowing what keywords or phrases your target audience is searching for can help you optimize your content and your website's meta descriptions and header tags to attract search engine crawlers. Use tools like google keyword planner, seo book, or google search console to conduct keyword research.

2. Optimize your website structure: a well-organized website structure is key to improving user experience and increasing page views. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up content into easy-to-understand sections, and make sure the main heading (h1) for each page matches its primary purpose and keywords.

3. Optimize your meta description and header tags: meta descriptions are text snippets that appear below a page's title in search results. Optimizing these descriptions with relevant keywords is crucial to improving visibility. Use headline-style language, include specific benefits or value propositions, and avoid using sales language or empty phrases. Your header tags (h1, h2, etc.) Should also be optimized with the same level of importance.

4. Optimize your site for mobile users: while desktop computers are the norm in most industries, mobile search volumes are growing faster than desktop searches. Ensure that your website is fully responsive and compatible across all devices, including desktops and tablets, to improve visibility and attract more traffic from smartphone users.

5. Use a content management system (cms) that supports optimization: if you're using a cms like wordpress or wix, consider switching to a platform with built-in tools for optimizing your website for better performance. Popular options include yola, drupal, and sphinn.

6. Test your site regularly: conduct regular tests to see which pages perform the best and which ones require improvement. Use analytics tools to track visitor behavior and adjust your content strategy accordingly.

7. Monitor and analyze your performance: use tools like google analytics or seo book to monitor and analyze your website's traffic, bounce rates, conversion rates, and other key metrics. Use this information to make data-driven decisions about how to optimize your site for better performance in the future.

Remember that optimizing a website is a long-term process that requires patience and dedication. Start by taking small steps to improve your existing website, then gradually work your way towards improving the overall performance of your site over time.
