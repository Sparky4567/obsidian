      <description>Oct 17  [!tldr] Oct 17 You were searching for a way to use Grammarly in your notes. Here it is.
 Boy, oh boy. The majority of this site visitors come here to check if there is even the slightest possibility to use the Grammarly plugin in Obsidian Notes. The short answer is no. There is no possibility to use the plugin.
On the other hand, due to raised traffic, I had to find another way to use Grammarly without any external apps.</description>

      <description>Jul 16  [!tldr] Jul 16 Just another post. This one is about the best blogging system around. To sum up, it does not exist.
 Is there a perfect content management system for blogging? I still doubt it.
You see, I tried almost every possible tool that I could find all over the internet.
Joomla, WordPress, Jekyll, Hugo, Blogger - you name it. I even constructed a blogging tool myself a long time ago to prove that it is possible to usae almost any web tool you like to create a website you will enjoy using.</description>
