Did not read again? This is a shor post about how I use the information I find to create some of my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you might be interested in the information I use in writing my newest blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell you one thing. I use multiple sources from different places all around the internet and even some of my old notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every time I need to write something about the code or tools I use, I read lots of documentation and test a few things before writing. I want to make correct assumptions based on my personal experience, so that is why I investigate a bunch of functionalities myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is helpful when you want to write some lengthy technical texts, but what about something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to use any of the TikTok videos as a base material for a start? Well, of course, it would. Though, you would need to view the material as sceptically as possible. Not everything you find on the internet is the truth. You may need to make the conclusions yourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my recipe is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify which parts of it are accurate and which are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recheck the information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read some documentation or research papers if it is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a chance that you could test the theory? Test it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down your conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your post and publish it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
