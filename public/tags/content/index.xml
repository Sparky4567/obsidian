&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize keywords: The more targeted and relevant your keywords are, the better. Use them naturally in your content but also don&amp;rsquo;t overdo it as this can be seen as spamming by search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use headings: Incorporate headings in your content to break it up into smaller chunks for easier reading. Headings should be used consistently throughout the article or blog post and provide a clear structure to your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a strong title: The title is the first thing people see on a webpage, so make sure it&amp;rsquo;s attention-grabbing. Use your keywords in the title but also include something that makes it relevant to your target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimize images: Use alt text for images to provide descriptive information about what they contain. This can help search engines understand what each image is about and improve their ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write engaging content: Your content should be informative, entertaining, and of high quality. It should have a clear purpose and be written in a conversational style that makes sense to your target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimize for mobile devices: More than half of all internet traffic now comes from mobile devices. Make sure your website is responsive and easy to navigate on smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use schema markup: Schema markup allows search engines to understand the content of your pages better, which can improve their ranking. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re using it on all of your content pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage with your audience: Engage with your readers by answering questions, responding to comments and answering frequently asked questions in your niche. This can help build trust and credibility with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide value: To attract and retain readers, provide valuable information and insights that are relevant to your target audience&amp;rsquo;s needs. Don&amp;rsquo;t just fill your content with data, but also share unique perspectives or insights that help solve problems for your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright infringement is a serious issue that can have a significant impact on businesses and individuals alike. It occurs when someone uses or replicates another&amp;rsquo;s original work without permission, including words, music, images, videos, or software. If you&amp;rsquo;re a writer or creative individual, this could be especially damaging to your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to protect your written content from copyright infraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t share your ideas with anyone else: Before sharing your work with anyone else, make sure they have permission to use it. If you create a piece of content on behalf of your business or organization, ask the rights holder for permission beforehand. It&amp;rsquo;s also essential not to reuse content that has already been published elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure all sources are cited: When writing about something you found online, make sure to cite the original source so others can check their work and verify its validity. Also, ensure that the copied material is properly attributed to the original creator(s) in your document or article. This helps avoid copyright infringement while also giving credit where credit is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Creative Commons Licenses: Creative Commons allows you to share your work under a license that grants others permission to use it. It&amp;rsquo;s important to read the license before using any content, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not sure about its usage terms. When appropriate, consider using CC-BY or CC0 (Public Domain) licenses so that they can be used freely by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay up to date with copyright laws: Make sure you know the current copyright law in your country, region, or industry. Keeping up with new legislation and adapting to it is essential for protecting your work from infringement. It can also help you avoid legal action and preserve your rights in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a WordPress Plugin: There are several WordPress plugins that help protect your content. The Free Content ID plugin allows you to add a &amp;ldquo;Free Content&amp;rdquo; tag to your posts or pages, while the Mega Content ID plugin also lets you use a free or premium WordPress theme with an added tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, protecting your written content from copyright infraction is essential for maintaining it as valuable and original work. By taking these precautions, you can ensure that you keep your intellectual property safe while still allowing others to publish their ideas effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
