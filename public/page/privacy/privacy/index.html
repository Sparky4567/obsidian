It is Artefaktas&rsquo;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu">https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu</a> (hereinafter, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<a href="https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu">https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu</a>&rdquo;).
