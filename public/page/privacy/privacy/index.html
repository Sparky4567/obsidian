        <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
<p>Artefaktas is located at:</p>
<p>Artefaktas, Lithuania
It is Artefaktas&rsquo;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu">https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu</a> (hereinafter, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<a href="https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu">https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu</a>&rdquo;). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website.

<p>Website Visitors</p>
<p>Like most website operators, Artefaktas collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Artefaktas&rsquo;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Artefaktas&rsquo;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Artefaktas may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Artefaktas also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu">https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu</a> blog posts. Artefaktas only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>
<p>Certain visitors to Artefaktas&rsquo;s websites choose to interact with Artefaktas in ways that require Artefaktas to gather personally-identifying information.

For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <a href="https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu">https://nerdy.artefaktas.eu</a> to provide an email address.</p>
